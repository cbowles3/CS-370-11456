Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, we were given the majority of the code for the project. Our job was to write the code in the 'pseudocode' section that fleshes out what the agent does in each epoch of testing. Some examples of operations are choosing actions through either random selection or by predicting the Q-value. It is also where results of the testing is saved for the agent to review later and optimize actions.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists do many various tasks including software development, cybersecurity, system design, and machine learning. This class in particular focused in on the role computer scientists play in current and emerging trends, which is mainly AI and machine learning. These jobs are essential in today's world, by providing innovative solutions to the problems in many different fields. Computer scientists can help improve technology in hospitals for example, by improving diagnostic machines to help diagnose patients faster and more accurately.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Methodically. A computer scientist must use logic and follow a process to solve problems. Working methodically helps reduce the margin of error in our work by allowing us to plan our work. It is also important to document changes in our work with comments or pseudocode to help others who view our work.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ultimately, our ethical responsibility is to cause no harm to the end user or organization. This could be financial loss, data misuse, personal information leakage, or security breaches. It is our job to make sure that our products are secure, safe, and helpful. Any organization we represent should be proud of the work we deliver as it it represents them more than it does us personally.
